Hello There product repo

My name is Claude Edward Baxter.
I was born September 24, 1985 to Terry Emma Baxter and Claude Ingamore Baxter, in Corpus Christi, TX.
I grew up in Aransas Pass, TX, graduated highschool in Ingleside, TX, and graduated college from Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, TX
I currently live in Corpus Christi, TX and work in property management for short term rentals and multi-family housing.

I've worked in various jobs throughout my life, bouncing from industry to industry.
I want to build a dAPP on the Algorand Blockchain that allows users to send and receive transactions anonymously.
I would like this dAPP to be controlled by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that makes decisions via governance protocols.
I was naive to think that I could afford to pay a developer to create something like this for me.
I will pay for these sins by learning the necessary skills to produce this decentralized application.

This is the beginning of my final journey.

If you are interested in joining me on this absurd quest, shoot me an email at e.baxter@dark-coin.io.
I could definitely use the help and company.
